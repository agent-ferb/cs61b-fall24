Observations:
1. MyHashMap performs comparably to Java’s built-in `HashMap`,
indicating good scalability and efficiency.
2. ULLMap does not handle large datasets well, resulting in stack
overflow errors for large inputs.
3. HashMaps are ideal when fast access is prioritized over key ordering,
while TreeMaps (BSTMap) are more suitable when sorted keys are required
for operations.
